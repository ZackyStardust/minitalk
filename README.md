## üó£Ô∏è About

> _You set up the server and it gives you a pid. Then, you can launch as many terminals as you want to execute the client and use de PID to send strings to the server._

One of the first projects on the second level of the 42 common core is the minitalk. You can only use signals of 0 and 1 to send strings from the client to the server.. When you set up the server, it gives you its pid. You execute the client typing the pid and the string. The client breaks down the string into bits, sends their 0s and 1s to the server, who wait until it has 8 bits, interprets it back into a byte and prints the byte on the terminal. The process is repeated until every byte has been sent, interpreted and printed on the terminal. It is also able to receive and print different types of characters, like emojis.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run
- Clone this repo.
- Type ```make```.
- Open two terminals. In one, execute the server. Copy the displayed pid.
- In the second terminal, execute the client. The first argument should be the pid, and the second, the string.
